Hey everyone!!
this project is regarding the aruco markers 

To start with the project , i divided the project in three main categories
1. Detection of the colour
2. Determine the orientation of the markers
3. Put the marker as per the respective id and as per the required orientation



**To determine the orientation i have used the math funtion 'atan2' which will calculate the tilt or the angle from the horizontal






*now for colour detection first we'll convert our image into hsv(hue saturation image)first because deafaukt rgb image won't allow us to carry out task
as per given colours
*Hsv image will diffrenciate colour on basis of instensity of gray colour present in them
**We'll create mask for diffrent colour range and
(**FOR GREEN we could also use cv.split funtion )

**next we will use cv.bitwise_or : operator/funtion between the imag and the respective rotated image marker to get the the intersection part for each colour  



now in the last part we finally have to put the aruco markers on the square 
for this we have to rotate it in direction of the coloured squared boxes to match the exact orientation

*Created a rotate funtion for the plane rotation which will take the img from all colours one by one and rotate and paste the markers according to that respective square
#note:was not able to figure out how to create funtion for geo rotate angle to call and implement the 3-d allignment as well

*after this i have import the marker images and store them in respectetive id format
then check the condion with bitwised masked images and draw the marker using drawmarker funtion on the respective shape
